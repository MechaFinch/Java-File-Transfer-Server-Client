# JavaFileTransferServer/Client

A (fairly) simple client and server mostly for sending/recieving files from one computer to another.

Current features:
-Connect multiple clients at once (untested)
-Send text to server (temporary and permanant)
-Download text from server (temporary deletes automatically on download)
-Files/text sent have an id and password attached

Future features:
-Send/download files to server (temporary and permanant)
-Text/files encrypted before being sent (password acts as key?)
-Deleting text/files from server
-Maybe other stuff
